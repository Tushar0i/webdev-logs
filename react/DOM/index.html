<!-- The DOM is a tree-like structure that the browser creates from your HTML page.
It represents everything inside your webpage (like <h1>, <p>, <img>, etc.) as objects that JavaScript can access and modify.
It is part of the Web/Browser APIs provided by browsers â€” that JS can use to manipulate web pages. -->
